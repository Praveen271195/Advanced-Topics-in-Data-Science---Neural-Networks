Course Syllabus: DSCI 789 - Advanced Topics in Data Science: Neural Networks for Data Science

Course Description

This course will cover modern and deep neural networks with a focus on how they can be used by a data scientist. It will cover the backpropagation algorithm and how it is used in modern feedforward, recurrent and convolutional neural networks. An emphasis will be placed on the implementation, design and training of neural networks for applied data science tasks. The course will include a project where students learn and utilize a modern neural network framework.

Software and Hardware

Students will have access to the Masters of Data Science computing system via SSH (secure shell) connection, which will provide CPU and GPU resources if needed. Programming assignments will be done in the Java programming language, and the student's term project will be done in Python using a modern neural network framework. Assignments will be submitted by Git using Git Classroom.

Other RIT Online Services

Google Apps for Education: RIT provides Google docs for students wishing to use a collaboration tool. Please note that if you use Google docs, be sure to keep a backup copy of your material. Downloading from google docs can change a documents format, so be sure to proof read materials before submitting. http://google.rit.edu
Method of Instruction

The course will be taught in person using a combination of lecture and lab sessions.

Schedule and Time Commitment

Each course week runs from Monday to Sunday midnight each week. To succeed in this course plan to spend 9 to 12 hours each week:

Reviewing lecture notes and reading the course text.
Developing source code for the programming assignments.
Working on a group term project.
Attendance Policy

Attendence is required for the on campus. All requests for excused absences are accepted only by email to your instructor before the beginning of class. Deductions to your final grade will be applied as follows:

Number of Missed Classes	Reduction to Final Grade
1	5%
2	15%
3	30%
4+	Four or more missed classes will result in a failing grade.
Grading

Policies

Academic Integrity

As an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. RIT Online encourages all students to become familiar with the RIT Honor Code and with RIT's Academic Integrity Policy.

Any copied text or figures without proper citation in and written or presented documents will be considered plagiarism and will be treated as such per RITs policies. A first offense will result in a 0 on the assignment, and a second offense will result in failure of the course and potential removal from the program.

Programming assignments are to be completed individually. While discussion of the assignments between students is encouraged, under no circumstances should code be shared between students. Any copied source code between students will be flagged as cheating, with those assignments recieving a 0. Depending on severity, further action may be taken, such as a referral to the student's department chair and advisor.

Further, any source code utilized in the programming assignments and projects which has been taken from an online source must be cited within code comments and a hyperlink provided to the website source. Failure to do so will be treated as plagiarism, with similar consequences as to copying source code as described above.

Reasonable Accommodations

RIT is committed to providing reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities. If you would like to request accommodations such as special seating or testing modifications due to a disability, please contact the Disability Services Office. It is located in the Student Alumni Union, Room 1150; the Web site is http://www.rit.edu/dso. After you receive accommodation approval, it is imperative that you see me during office hours so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.
